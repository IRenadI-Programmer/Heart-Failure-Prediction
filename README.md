Project Motivation:


We chose this dataset because heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, and early identification of at-risk individuals can significantly improve survival rates.
By using key health indicators like age, blood pressure, and cholesterol, our goal is to develop a classification model that identifies people at risk, enabling timely interventions. Additionally, clustering techniques can help uncover hidden patterns or risk factors, offering deeper insights. 
This project allows us to apply machine learning to a real-world healthcare challenge, addressing a critical health issue affecting millions globally.
